# Car Price Analysis

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. 

### Data Sources
Car Price Analysis: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Car-Price.csv" file, containing detailed information about each car variable and how the price varies with the independent variables.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning 
- Power Bi - Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
#### The following data cleaning steps were carried out on this data:
- Removing the special characters that our data came with, 
- Removing the duplicate car names, 
- Trimming some of the rows and capitalizing the necessary words. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Car Price data to answer key questions such as :
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
- How well those variables describe the price of a car?
- Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market.

### Data Analysis
This analysis was done in Power Bi

### Results/Findings
The analysis results/findings are summarized as follows:
- The price of cars with some certain car types, engine size, fuel type, drivewheel, aspiration type etc tends to be high while the prices of some are low, thereby making our aspiring automobile manufacturing company (Geely Auto) understands which car type, engine size, fuel type, drivewheel, aspiration type etc they should manufacture more or less to be able to efficiently compete with the American Market.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following action:
- Design cars that can handle the terrain, whether urban, rural, or off-road
- Ensure that the car meets local safety, emissions and import regulations.
- Divide the market into sectors (e.g., budget-friendly, luxury, or electric vehicles) and focus on the most profitable sector.
- 
### Limitations 
I had to remove the duplicated car names because they would have affected the accuracy of my analysis.
